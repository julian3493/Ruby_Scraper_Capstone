# Ruby Scraper Capstone

 In this project, I create a scraper script that obtains a list of anime from `https://www3.animeflv.net/browse` and shows the data in the terminal. It ask if you want more information about one of the anime listed and shows that information if you want.
 I choose that page because it could be useful for me and some of my friends.
